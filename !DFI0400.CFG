; Configuration file for DFI E586-ICP/E586-IPE SYSTEM BOARD
; Revision: 0.03
; Created by omega552003
;    09/13/2022
; This is a from scratch EISA config file and doesn't work properly.  I think 
; that DFI had additional Overlays and or special addressing related to this 
; board. This should be used for informational use and not for production use.
;
; Tested on E586-IPE

BOARD
	ID = "DFI0400"
	NAME = "DFI E586-ICP/E586-IPE SYSTEM BOARD"
	MFR = "Diamond Flower, Inc."
	CATEGORY = "SYS"
	SLOT = EMB(0)
;	LENGTH = 330	;Specifies the length of the board in millimeters. You sho-
    ;uld include a LENGTH statement so that the ECU can optimize slot allocati-
    ;on. Otherwise, the default value of 330 is used. The LENGTH statement does
    ;not apply to embedded or virtual devices.
;	AMPERAGE = 0	;Specifies the maximum amount of continuous 5-volt current 
    ;(in milliamps) required by the base configuration of the expansion board. 
    ;If your device requires more than 5 volts of power, you should include an
    ;AMPERAGE statement. Otherwise, the default value of 0 is used.
;	SKIRT  = NO	    ;With the SKIRT statement, indicates whether a drop-down 
    ;skirt is present to prevent installation into a 16-bit slot. The default 
    ;value is NO.
	READID = YES	;With the READID statement, indicates whether the expansion
    ;board's ID can be read from the EISA ID registers. The default value is NO
;	BUSMASTER = 0	;Indicates that the board is a bus master. The latency arg-
    ;ument specifies the maximum acceptable latency, in microseconds, from the 
    ;bus master bus request to the bus grant.
;	SIZING = 0	    ;Specifies the minimum number of Kbytes of memory to be us-
    ;ed as the sizing gap. The default is 0.
;	IOCHECK = VALID	;Specifies support of the EISA expansion board control reg-
    ;ister IOCHKERR bit. VALID (the default) indicates that the expansion board
    ;responds to reads of its IOCHKERR bit; INVALID indicates that the expansi-
    ;on board does not respond to this bit.
;	DISABLE = SUPPORTED	    ;Specifies support of the EISA expansion board con-
    ;trol register ENABLE bit. SUPPORTED (the default) indicates that the user 
    ;can disable the expansion board by clearing the ENABLE bit; UNSUPPORTED 
    ;indicates that the user cannot disable the expansion board by clearing th-
    ;is bit.
;	VERSION = 0     ;Specifies the version number.
;	REV = 0	        ;Specifies the version number.
;	COMMENTS="This is the Board Identification Block comment field for the EISA
    ;-486 Demo Board"
    ;Specifies up to 600 characters of text that the ECU can display.
;	HELP="This is the main board configuration help field for EISA-486 Demo Bo-
    ;ard."	
    ;Specifies up to 600 characters of text to display if the user requests help.
