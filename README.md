# EISA_Config_DFI0400.CFG
An attempt to create the DFI E586-IPE's EISA Configuration file from scratch.

Revision: 0.03

This is a from scratch EISA config file and doesn't work properly.  I think 
that DFI had additional Overlays and or special addressing related to this 
board. This should be used for informational use and not for production use.

Tested on E586-IPE
